# SAP UI5 Demo Fragments And Dialogs

Fragments are light-weight UI parts (UI subtrees) which can be reused but do not have any controller. This means, whenever you want to define a certain part of your UI to be reusable across multiple views, or when you want to exchange some parts of a view against one another under certain circumstances (different user roles, edit mode vs read-only mode), a fragment is a good candidate, especially where no additional controller logic is required.

A fragment can consist of 1 to n controls. At runtime, fragments placed in a view behave similar to "normal" view content, which means controls inside the fragment will just be included into the viewâ€™s DOM when rendered. There are of course controls that are not designed to become part of a view, for example, dialogs. But even for these controls, fragments can be particularly useful, as you will see in a minute.

The code you've shared is a fragment definition in SAPUI5, which is a framework developed by SAP for creating web applications. Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Code Explaination

Refer to [/webapp/view/HelloDialog.fragment.xml](https://github.com/VaibhavMojidra/SAP-UI5---Demo-Fragments-And-Dialogs/blob/master/webapp/view/HelloDialog.fragment.xml "HelloDialog.fragment.xml")

`<core:FragmentDefinition>`: This is the root element of the fragment. It defines a reusable piece of UI.

`xmlns="sap.m"` and `xmlns:core="sap.ui.core"`: These are XML namespace declarations. They define the XML namespaces for the `sap.m` and `sap.ui.core` libraries, respectively.

`<Dialog id="helloDialog" title="Hello"/>`: This is a Dialog control from the `sap.m` library. It has an ID of "helloDialog" and a title of "Hello". This dialog can be reused in different parts of your application.

The code you've shared is a SAPUI5 controller definition. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Refer to [/webapp/controller/App.controller.js](https://github.com/VaibhavMojidra/SAP-UI5---Demo-Fragments-And-Dialogs/blob/master/webapp/controller/App.controller.js "App.controller.js")

`sap.ui.define`: This is the SAPUI5 module loader. It loads the specified dependencies and executes the callback function once they're loaded.

`["sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller"]`: This is an array of dependencies. In this case, it's loading the `Controller` module from `sap/ui/core/mvc`.

`function(Controller) {...}`: This is the callback function that's executed once the dependencies are loaded. The loaded modules are passed as arguments to this function.

`Controller.extend("com.vaibhavmojidra.fragmentsanddialogsdemo.controller.App", {...})`: This creates a new controller that extends the base `Controller`. The first argument is the name of the new controller, and the second argument is an object that defines the methods for this controller.

`onClick:function(){...}`: This is a method of the controller. It's executed when the `onClick` event is triggered.

`this.pDialog ??= this.loadFragment({...})`: This line loads a fragment and assigns it to `this.pDialog` if `this.pDialog` is not already defined (`??=` is a logical nullish assignment operator in JavaScript).

`this.pDialog.then((oDialog) => oDialog.open())`: This line opens the dialog once it's loaded. The `then` method is used because `loadFragment` returns a promise.
